## About Killer Game

### Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them :

* Python 3.4 or higher
* Django 2.0.2 or higher

### Customizing config.json

If you intend to use the Killer Game, you will need to change settings in the config.json file.

In this initial version, we send missions and targets to the players via SMS using esendex APIs. Create your account and fill in the specific tokens :

```bash
"username":"<YOUR_USERNAME>",
"password":"<YOUR_PASSWORD>",
"accountReference":"<YOUR_ACCOUNT_REFERENCE>",
"expeditor":"Killer Game"
```

In a coming version, you will be able to connect to your Slack workspace.

### Limitations

Killer Game is a "one shot" app that I developed "as it is" :)
It is still work in progress and may have a lot of potential optimizations.
Among potential new features :

* Be multi_lingual (app is in French in its initial version)
* Be connected to Slack
* Enable multiple games
